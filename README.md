# Dev Containers

Dev Containers experiments for VS Code. These contain modified Dockerfiles that
are purposed for what I might need to use.

## How Should I Use It?

Copy the `devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile` into a `.devcontainer` directory
inside the project root and start working with the project!
